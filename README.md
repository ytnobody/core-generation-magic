# Introducing Core Generation: A New Arena for Competitive Magic

## What is Core Generation?

Core Generation is an unofficial, fan-made competitive format for Magic: The Gathering designed to challenge established norms and reward pure deckbuilding ingenuity. It is built on four core pillars:

1.  **The elimination of Planeswalkers.**
2.  **An expanded Legacy-level card pool.**
3.  **Strict limitations on card stability and rarity (including a 3-copy limit for all non-basic cards).**
4.  **A hard 3-copy limit for all non-basic cards.**

This format seeks to be the spiritual successor to the game's pre-Planeswalker era, focusing on the dynamic interaction between creatures, spells, and strategic land use.

## Why Was Core Generation Created?

The format was conceived to address two major concerns in contemporary competitive Magic:

* **The Dominance of Planeswalkers (PWs):** PWs often create asymmetrical advantage, diminishing the importance of traditional creature combat and spell interaction. We eliminate them to bring the game back to its core.
* **The Stagnation of Optimized Staples:** In many Eternal formats, top-tier decks rely on playing four copies of every highly efficient Rare/Mythic card and expensive dual lands. This raises the barrier to entry and stifles creative deckbuilding.

Core Generation is the solution: **a diverse, skill-testing, and more accessible competitive environment.**

## The Goals of Core Generation

* **Reward Creativity over Financial Power:** By limiting the use of high-rarity cards and forcing players to rely on synergies from cheaper cards, we ensure skill and innovation, not wallet size, determine victory.
* **Maximize Diversity and Synergy:** The severe **3-copy limit** for all non-basic cards destabilizes established "4-of" strategies, forcing players to explore the vast card pool for obscure, synergistic alternatives.
* **Give Older Decks a Second Life:** Decks from past Standard environments that were overshadowed by Planeswalkers can be upgraded with Legacy-level Commons and Uncommons and become viable threats once again.

# The Core Generation Regulations

## 1. Core Gameplay and Ban Rules

* **Identical Card Limit:** **Maximum 3 copies** of any non-basic land card in the entire 75 (Main Deck + Sideboard).
* **Card Pool:** All cards from **_Revised Edition_ or any later set** are legal for use.
* **Banned List:** All **Planeswalker cards** are banned, plus the current **Legacy** ban list.
* **Rarity Determination Rule:** **Rarity for deckbuilding constraints is determined by the specific version of the card being used. The printed expansion symbol on the physical card determines its rarity.** *(Example: A Prophecy printing of Rhystic Study counts as a Common. A later printing where it appears as a Rare must be counted as a Rare towards the total 8 Rare/Mythic limit.)*
## 2. Deckbuilding Restrictions (Main Deck Only)

The total number of high-rarity cards in your 60-card Main Deck (excluding basic lands) is strictly limited:

* **Mythic Rare:** **Max 2 total copies**
    * *(Rationale: Limits the absolute power ceiling of the deck.)*
* **Rare:** **Max 8 total copies** (Including the 2 Mythics)
    * *(Rationale: Dramatically limits reliance on high-cost lands and powerful rare threats.)*
* **Uncommon / Common:** Only the **3-copy limit** applies.
    * *(Rationale: Encourages deep card knowledge and robust synergy across a wide range of affordable cards.)*

***Note on Sideboards:*** The 3-copy rule applies to the Sideboard. However, the Rarity Total Limits (Mythic 2, Total 8) **DO NOT** apply to the Sideboard.
