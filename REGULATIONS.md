Core Generation Magic uses the **London Mulligan** rule:

1. Each player draws 7 cards
2. Each player, in turn order, may take a mulligan by shuffling their hand into their library and drawing 7 new cards
3. After deciding to keep their hand, a player who has taken any mulligans puts a number of cards from their hand on the bottom of their library equal to the number of mulligans taken
4. Players may mulligan as many times as they wish (drawing 7 each time, then bottoming cards equal to mulligans taken)

### 5.2 Mulligan Etiquette
- Players should mulligan in turn order (starting player first)
- Once a player keeps their hand, they may not take additional mulligans
- In competitive play, players must keep their hand face-down until both players have finished mulliganing
